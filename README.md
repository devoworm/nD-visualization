# nD-visualization (Introduction):

Image files contain graphs with various types of visualization. All code located in .md files, data source specified in .md file.  

Main types of vizualizations are point spheres, networks, transformations (maps), and combinations of the three. See file name and .md file for more details.  


## Packages for generating graphs:  

Plotly   [link](https://plot.ly/python/)

MatPlotLib   [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib)

SciLab (can use MatPlotLib within this environment)   [link](https://www.scilab.org/)

RStudio (can use Plotly within this environment   [link](https://www.rstudio.com/)

JupyterLab   [link](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyterlab)
