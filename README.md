# nD-visualization (Introduction):

Image files contain graphs with various types of visualization. All code located in .md files, data source specified in .md file.  

Main types of vizualizations are point spheres, networks, transformations (maps), and combinations of the three. See file name and .md file for more details.  


## Packages for generating graphs:  

Plotly   [link](https://plot.ly/python/)

MatPlotLib   [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib)

## Specific files of interest:

Spatialization scheme for half of early embryo (16-cell stage with ancestors, ancestral cell bodies not shown).  

embryo-transforms.md  
Contains code for circular band and saddle mappings.
